# Photoelectric-Effect
A simple project that calculates whether photoemission occurs based on photon energy and work function, and visualizes the results with a graph. The program determines the likelihood of photoemission.

To calculate the energy of photon, I used the following equation: <br> <br>

**Where:**
  E = Energy of radiation in Joules (J)
  h = Planck's Constant e.g $6.63..*10^-34$
  f = frequency of the radiation ray in Hertz (Hz)
